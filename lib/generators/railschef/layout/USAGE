Description:
  The railschef layout generator creates a basic layout and helper
  which will give some structure to a starting Rails app.

  The generator takes one argument which will be the name of the
  layout and stylesheet files. If no argument is passed then it defaults
  to "application".

  The helper module includes some methods which can be called in any
  template or partial to set variables to be used in the layout, such as
  page title and javascript/stylesheet includes.

Examples:
    rails generate railschef:layout

        Layout: app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
        Helper: app/helpers/layout_helper.rb
                app/helpers/error_messages_helper.rb


    rails generate railschef:layout admin

        Layout: app/views/layouts/admin.html.erb
        Helper: app/helpers/layout_helper.rb
                app/helpers/error_messages_helper.rb
